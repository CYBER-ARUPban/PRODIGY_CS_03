Password Complexity Checker
This is a simple Python tool that checks the strength of a password based on common security criteria. It helps users understand how secure their password is and provides suggestions for improvement.

Features
Checks for:

  1.Minimum length (8 characters)

  2.Uppercase letters

  3.Lowercase letters

  4.Numbers

  5.Special characters

  6.Assigns a strength rating:

  7.Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong

  8.Gives clear feedback on what’s missing

Requirements
Python 3.x
(No external libraries required.)

How It Works
You run the script and enter a password when prompted. The tool evaluates it based on five rules. Each rule met adds to the password’s score, and a final strength rating is given. If any rules are unmet, the tool lists them clearly.

Usage
Run the script.
Enter a password when prompted.
Read the strength result and feedback.
Adjust the password accordingly.
